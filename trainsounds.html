/*
Project goals: 
Have steam sounds that are always on
Have chuffing noises where the speed can be adjusted
Have a bell sound that can be turned on and off
Have some sort of whistle
    1. Have buttons for the different lengths of whistle
    2. Have a pull cord where the whistle length and pitch can be controlled
       This option is much harder but more satisfying 
Eventually, when I get more sounds to work with, 
    have a way to switch between different locomotives,
    have a diesel option, etc
Finally, figure out how to convert it to app format
Also, could connect it to lego trains if I can
    somehow figure out bluetooth
Those goals are pretty lofty so we'll see how far we can get


*/
/*
To do: 
Add a simple animation that lets me
    know the code is working
Add stuff that makes audio work
Figure out how to control volume of audio
Add steam sounds that fades to create seamless loop
